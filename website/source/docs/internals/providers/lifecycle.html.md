# Terraform Lifecycle

Terraform runs follow a predictable lifecycle: gather information, detect
diffs, apply updates, set state.

Information is gathered from two places: the config and the state. The config
is populated from the userâ€™s config file; the state is populated from the
statefile. But before the state gets populated from the statefile, the
statefile is refreshed, using information about the provider(s) to get a more
accurate picture of the world. It then gets passed through an optional
per-resource `StateFunc`, which allows resources to modify their representation
in the state. Finally, the config and state get passed through an optional
`DiffSuppressFunc`, which allows resources to decide whether a config value and
a state value should be considered equivalent. This results in our diff.

Once we have that diff, we know which resources need to be created, updated, or
destroyed. The `Create`, `Update`, and `Destroy` functions for the resources
are called as appropriate, and the `ResourceData` instance they modify is
persisted as the state when the call returns.
